My p5.js artwork and the image made by ChatGPT both show a cat sitting by a window at night, but they look very different. My sketch uses basic shapes and flat colors, which makes it more simple and playful. The cat and window are not very detailed, but they clearly show the idea of the scene. The AI image, on the other hand, looks more realistic and detailed. It includes shading, texture, and a more emotional nighttime mood with stars and lighting.

This shows the difference between making art with code and having an image generated by AI. When I coded my artwork, I had to decide how to represent everything using simple shapes, which made me think more about design and structure. The AI focused more on how the scene should feel rather than how it is built. My artwork is more abstract, while the AI’s is more realistic. Even though both images show the same idea, they interpret it in different ways.
